# AdventOfCode2024Rust
Advent of Code 2024, solved in Rust and ordered by Day. This was a learning project, so some of the code may be considered subpar (but functional).

### How it works

Each folder contains challenges of a given day from https://adventofcode.com/2024. 
To run a specific solution, navigate to the day and project folder (i.e. cd Day2/ReactorCodes) and run with 

>cargo run

Own puzzle inputs are provided in the corresponding folders.
